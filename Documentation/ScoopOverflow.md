### ***Scoop Overflow***

- *A simple ice cream simulation made to learn more about overflow (binary wise). It implements overflow in the form of resetting the scoop amount back to zero after 5 scoops of ice cream. It is an abstraction of an actual ice cream cone (if you couldn't quite tell). Just like the binary homework, I didn't honestly struggle since they both reuqire the knowledge abaout overflow and binary (which I am confident about). Overall, it was not so difficult.*
