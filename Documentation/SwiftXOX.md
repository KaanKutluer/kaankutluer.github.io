### ***Swift XOX***

- *This was **THE** first homework I had so it is kind of special. It marks the beginning of my Swift Journey (I know I am talking too much, btw). Anyways, the code itself is pretty simple, just colorful boxes with shapes in them. All I had to do was to adjust their positions on my screen, color them, size them and then put "X" or "O" inside each one of them. Overall, one of the most basic thing you can do.*
