### ***Clock V3***

- *Clock V3 was the father of Clock V5 (aka my **Honored Clock**). The two aren't that much different besides the fact the Clock V3 doesn't have any numbers on it (no indicators of what the hour is on the clock itself) while also not having a "Jump to Random Hour Function". Besides these facts, they are pretty much the same. But, Clock V3 was also the first one to change it's color when "AM" switched to "PM" and vica versa. So, overall, creating Clock V3 wasn't difficult.*
