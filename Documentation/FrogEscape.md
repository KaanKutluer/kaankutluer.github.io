### ***Frog Escape***

- *This homework was BY FAR the hardest of the quarter for me. It took me multiple tries to randomise the obstacles' trajectory and loction for a smoother gameplay. When free-environemnt didn't work, I decided to follow a very similar path with my fellow classmate (Bade) and created a maze-like game. But, even then, I struggled a lot. But, I also learned how to move my designated character with buttons which was a satisfying step for me (I used lines of code similar to the following: Button("⬅️") { moveFrog(dx: -1, dy: 0). Overall, this was a **very** hard but also rewarding homework.*
