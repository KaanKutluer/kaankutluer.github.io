### ***Swift Calc-Calc Calculator***

- *This homework was one of the earliest ones (One of the OGs) and it was relatively easy. The code relies on user input and does calculations based on the user inputs. After the user inputs two numbers, the calculator (WiTh It'S MaGiC) calculates the result of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and the division of the two numbers (since the calculations are codes into the coded). Overall, it was kind of a fun homework.*
