### ***Swift Binary Challenge***

- *This homework was one of the easier topics for me as I have really understood binary (since it is a relatively simple concept). I also did the extra credit part where we show overflow. The overflow occurs when the binary code reaches 1111 and the decimal reaches 16 since 4-bit binary can only go up to 16 (with 16 not being included). I didn't particularly struggle with anything for this one.*
