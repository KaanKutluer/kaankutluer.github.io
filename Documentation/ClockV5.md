### ***Clock V5***

- *I made this clock to learn more about the ForEach() and Random() functions in Swift. ForEach() makes everything much simpler in a code because it just allows us to write repeatitive actions **once** rather than writing them over and over while Random() allows us to pick random values or variables. While working on this clock, I also recalled how these two functions are similar to Scratch's "Repeat" and "Pick Random" functions which helped me understand it easier. Clock V5 also had numbers on the clock itself and a "Jump to random Hour" (Random()) function which made it better than it's predecessor, Clock V3. So, overall, a bit challenging.*
