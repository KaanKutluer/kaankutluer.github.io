### ***Data Compression***

#### ***1. Why does data get compressed and what algorithms are used?***

- *Data compression happens because digital files often have repeating patterns or extra information that can be stored more efficiently. The goal is to make the file smaller without losing meaning. Lossless algorithms keep all data while Lossy algorithms remove some data that humans don’t notice. This happens with algorithms like Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding and etc.*

#### ***2. Is it the same for video, photo, and text?***
- *The idea to remove redundancy is the same, but the methods are different. Text must use lossless (you can’t lose letters) while Photo/Video/Audio can use lossy (you can throw away details the eye or ear won’t notice).

#### ***3. Which programs do compression (online or installed)?***

- Online: TinyPNG, ILovePDF and etc. Installed: WinRAR, Adobe Acrobat and etc.

#### ***4. Example applications on picture, video, text, and PDF***
- Picture uses color averaging and removes unseen details. Video uses motion prediction (don’t save every frame, just changes). Text uses dictionary methods (replace repeating words/letters). PDF compresses by shrinking images inside and removing unused fonts.


####***5. Which formats are used?***
- ***Video: MP4, AVI, MOV.***

- ***Photo: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP.***

- ***Music/Audio: MP3, AAC, FLAC.***

- ***Text: TXT, DOCX, PDF, ZIP.***
