### **[Swift Playground - Clock V3  (The Final Before the Actual Final Version: V5)](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Swift_Playground)**

- A pretty basic clock app that changes the hour and/or minute once the buttons on the screen are clicked accordingly. Show the hour and the minute(s) while also showing whether it is AM or PM.

### **[Swift Playground - Clock V5  (The Honoured Clock)](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Swift_Playground)**

- This is how I created "The Honored Clock" which shall be remembered for its simple perfection.

- For this project, me and my partner decided to pick our target auidence as teenagers (since we are also teenagers). After that, we collected some images that would fit the bill for the design we had in mind through google and put them on a Figjam Ideas Board. We decided on the two we liked the most after that:

- After the idea-phase, we started to make our seperate designs. I used the hands on the first clock and simplfied them further while also adding numbers around the clock to make it look more basic. After that, I simply used my previous code and added the numbers around the clock while also adding a "Jump to Random Hour" function for fun which allowed me to learn about the ForEach function:

- And that is how I created my simple but glamarous clock.

### **[Swift Playground - Scoop Overflow  (The Melting Ice Cream of Greed)](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Swift_Playground)**

- A simple ice cream simulatiÄ±n where you can add scoops of ice cream onto an ice cream cone. But, the catch is that if you pass five scoop, it overflows back to zero scoops (PS, I know that my ice cream is a bit cursed).

- Also, here is the very simple code for the overflow and the scoop adding (REALLY simple, trust):

### **[Swift Playground - Binary Challenge (I Ran Out of Ideas for a Funny Titl at 1AM)]

- A challenge to create an 4-Bit (1-16 with 16 not being included) ID Counter which has both binary form and decimal form.

### **[Swift Playground - Fake XOX You Can't Play](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/tree/main/Projects/Swift_Playground)**

- Colorful boxes that have either "X" or "O" inside them.

### **[Swift Playground - Calc-Calc Calculator](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Swift_Playground)**

- A calculator app that does (you guessed it!) calculations via the inputs the user puts into the system.

### **[Scratch - Toe Tac Tic That You Can Actually Play!](https://kaankutluer.github.io/kaankutluer.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Block_Coding)**

- Simplest Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Literally). The game is meant to be played with a friend (you probably don't have one like me), with each click switching each box between X, O and blank.
