### ***Big Ideas 2.3 Reflection***

- *Big Ideas 2.3 is about extraction of information from data. The first thing I learned about this is the fact that data needs to be cleaned (I know, it sounds a bit weird but stay with me). Data cleaning is a way of getting rid of errors and incomplete information or repairing data. This process is important because it would be much harder to process data with all this unclean data that litters what really matters. The next thing I learned is metadata. Metadata is ALL information in a file that is not the main payload like the date at which a video is recorded or the name of the person who filmed the video. So, metadata is simply data about data that isnâ€™t a part of the main data.*
