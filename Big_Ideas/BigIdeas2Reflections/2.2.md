### ***Big Ideas 2.2 Reflection***

- *Big Ideas 2.2 is really about data compression. I learned that compressing data means that it will take less space on a computerâ€™s storage and therefore can be transferred faster later on. Data can be compressed in two main ways: Lossy Compression and Lossless Compression. During lossy compression some bits of information is lost in order for a better compression while lossless compression is better to preserve the quality of the data in exchange for less compression as it keeps all information intact and can be restored fully even after compression.*
