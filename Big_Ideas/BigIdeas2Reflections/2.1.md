### ***Big Ideas 2.1 Reflection***

- *Big Ideas 2.1 is mainly about Binary Numbers and storing data in binary format. I learned that all data stored (within our computers and THE Internet) is binary. Binary can be used to store all types of data like text, numbers, images and even videos or voice recordings. Computers use binary because it is really easy to show digitally. For instance, a computerâ€™s state (shoutout to the Coursera we did this summer) can simply be described as 0 (off) and 1 (on) by binary. Binary systems matter because they can efficiently store and transmit information in computers and the internet.*
