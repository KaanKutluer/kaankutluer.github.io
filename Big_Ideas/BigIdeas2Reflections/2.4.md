### ***Big Ideas 2.4 Reflection***

- *Big Ideas 2.4 is about using programs with data. I learned that using programs to analyze data gives us valuable insight for a set of data. Using programs also help us find patterns in sets of data that we can miss (computers can do it better than us with fever mistakes. Programs can also transform data into more visual concepts like graphs and tables for better understanding and comprehension.*
