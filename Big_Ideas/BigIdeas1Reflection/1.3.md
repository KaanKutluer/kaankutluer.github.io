### ***Big Ideas 1.3 Reflection***

- *Developing a program is a step-by-step process. First, developers investigate user needs through surveys or testing. Then they design, plan, and prototype ideas. Each version is tested and refined, often revisiting earlier steps. Breaking the problem into smaller parts makes it easier to build reliable, useful, and user-focused programs.*
